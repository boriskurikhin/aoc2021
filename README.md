# Advent of Code 2021

Was doing these at a decent pace for the first ~3.5 weeks.

Ran out of juice on day 23, and -- stopped.

Might complete the remaining 3 days sometime in the future.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the result this year ([after finally landing on the "Global Leaderboard" on Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/day/6)).
